Today, ML. cTLD suddenly stopped responding NS records of most subdomains, without an announcement.

I believe that it is not a mistake because it is not fixed in time and the NS server of ML is still online and responding NS records for GOUV.ML.

I understand the challenge and difficulties that Mali are facing. However, considering that Gabon stopped the free service of GA cTLD a few months ago, I think it is unreliable to continue to use ML.

I am deeply sorry for the inconvenience and loss caused by events happened today.
After thinking several times, I decided to migrate all services from XTEXX.ML. to XTEXX.EU.ORG.

I deeply know that this will cause many problems, such as old links and mailboxes. But this is a necessary step, a step towards DNSSEC and a step towards providing a more stable service.

Thanks.

I hate ML NIC, and Freenom.

Bye.
