# HiSilicon Device Tree Table (HSDT) file unpacker

This tool unpacks HSDT files, which are used by HiSilicon-based devices, for example, smart phones by Huawei.

On Huawei's smart phone devices using HiSilicon SoCs, device-tree table is stored in a partition named `dts`.

The format of HSDT is a bit (strictly speaking, 96 bits) simliar to QCDT files, which are used by Qualcomm devices. HSDT files begin with a header (`dt_table_t`) following by many entries (`dt_entry_t`). A magic value of 0x54445348 (`HSDT` in ASCII octects) is always placed at the head of HSDT files.

This tool is able to classify HSDT extracted from Huawei system update package (`UPDATE.APP`), which has an extra header of 4 KiB at the beginning, and HSDT dumped from Huawei smart phones (`/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/dts`). It can also GZIP-decompress extracted DTB files automatically and extract VRL data from the table (the VRL data is related to verification, but the VRL-extracting feature is not test, as I did not find any HSDT file with VRL data in my reverse engineering project of their fastboot).

To build this tools, run `make` with Zig tool-chain configured.

There is also a pattern of ImHex editor available at [the content store](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns/pull/280).

To unpack Huawei's update pack, the `UPDATE.APP` file, use [huextract](https://github.com/echo-devim/huextract), [HuaweiUpdateExtractor](https://github.com/Project-Satori/HuaweiUpdateExtractor) or [unpacktool by xjljian](https://github.com/xjljian/huawei_UPDATE.APP_unpacktool).
